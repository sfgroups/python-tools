Skills to Develop and Grow:
Advanced Technical Skills: Deepen your expertise in areas like cloud infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines, and container orchestration tools (like Kubernetes), as these are increasingly valuable for scalable deployment and automation.

Architectural Design and Strategy: Building on your experience with framework and module design, learning about system architecture patterns and design principles can help you approach projects from a high-level, strategic perspective.

Project Management and Planning: Familiarize yourself with Agile project management practices, beyond just Sprint methodologies. Understanding Agile frameworks can help you manage resources, timelines, and dependencies more efficiently.

Mentorship and Knowledge Sharing: Strengthen your influence by mentoring teammates and sharing your technical knowledge. This can deepen your leadership skills and foster a collaborative, learning-focused environment.

What to Do Differently or Continue in Future Interactions:
Continue Taking Ownership: Your initiative and ownership have been valuable, so keep taking on lead responsibilities for projects or specific features, ensuring consistency and thorough execution.

Enhance Communication and Stakeholder Engagement: To enhance project efficiency, keep refining your communication by setting clear expectations, actively seeking feedback, and keeping stakeholders updated on progress and any challenges you encounter.

Seek Continuous Feedback and Reflect: Regularly asking for feedback from teammates and supervisors will help you identify strengths and areas to adjust. Self-reflection on past projects to see what went well and what could improve can lead to continuous growth.

Collaborate on Cross-Functional Teams: Engage with team members from other departments or roles to broaden your perspective on the project lifecycle. This can enhance your understanding of the broader organizational impact and foster stronger cross-functional relationships.

By focusing on these areas, you'll build a well-rounded skill set, strengthen your leadership capabilities, and enhance your performance and impact on future projects.
