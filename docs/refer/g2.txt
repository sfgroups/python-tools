Pipeline Setup and Ongoing Support

Objective: Establish a CI/CD pipeline aligned with company standards, including stages for testing, security scanning, building Docker images, and deploying to an Azure Kubernetes cluster. Additionally, set up password vault integration and provide ongoing troubleshooting and support for the teams.

Key Results:

Pipeline Setup and Configuration:
Design and implement a CI/CD pipeline that includes the following stages:
Unit and integration testing with automated tools.
Security scanning using approved company tools (e.g., SonarQube, Fortify, Black Duck).
Building Docker images for application packaging.
Deployment to the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster.
Complete setup and configuration of the pipeline within 30 days, ensuring full compliance with company standards and security protocols.
Password Vault Integration:
Implement secure integration with the companyâ€™s password vault system (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, Azure Key Vault) to manage secrets and credentials in the pipeline.
Test and validate that all sensitive information is securely retrieved from the vault during pipeline execution without manual intervention.
Troubleshooting and Ongoing Support:
Provide timely support to development teams, resolving 90% of pipeline issues within 2 business days.
Conduct training and knowledge-sharing sessions with teams to address pipeline usage, security practices, and troubleshooting, with at least one session per quarter.
Ensure continuous monitoring and maintenance of the pipeline, adapting it to evolving team needs and changes to the application stack.
Documentation and Best Practices:
Create comprehensive documentation outlining the pipeline stages, security integrations, and troubleshooting processes.
Update documentation regularly based on changes to the pipeline or company policies, ensuring it is 100% up-to-date.
Success Criteria:

Fully operational CI/CD pipeline with no critical deployment issues after implementation.
Successful deployment to AKS within established SLAs.
No unaddressed security vulnerabilities from pipeline scanning.
Consistent support and high satisfaction from development teams as measured through feedback surveys.
