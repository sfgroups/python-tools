Application Security Remediation

Objective: Improve overall application security by remediating vulnerabilities identified through Twistlock, SonarQube, Fortify, and Black Duck code scanning tools.

Key Results:

Remediate Identified Vulnerabilities:
Address and resolve all Critical and High-severity vulnerabilities from Twistlock CVE scans within 15 business days of identification.
Remediate 80% of Medium-severity vulnerabilities within 30 business days.
Code Scan Security Issues:
Review, prioritize, and fix at least 95% of the security issues detected by SonarQube, Fortify, and Black Duck scans on a weekly basis.
Achieve zero open Critical security issues in SonarQube and Fortify by the end of each sprint.
Continuous Monitoring & Reporting:
Implement automated scanning for continuous monitoring, ensuring no new Critical or High vulnerabilities remain unaddressed for more than 10 business days.
Provide weekly reports on remediation progress, detailing resolved, pending, and newly identified vulnerabilities.
Success Criteria:

100% of Critical and High-severity vulnerabilities resolved within SLA.
Compliance with security best practices as evidenced by passing SonarQube, Fortify, and Black Duck scans with no blocking issues.
Reduced application security risk as demonstrated by lower vulnerability counts in monthly scans.
