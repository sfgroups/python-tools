Adjusting to new work environments can sometimes be a challenge, but I soon found myself settling in with company culture and process. I discovered immense value in being exposed to new insights and viewpoints.


With the agile nature of the team when things change, I understood the direction to re-focus and work towards supporting the team goals.

I promote a team-oriented work environment by sharing and assisting team members and accepting ideas from others.
I regularly consider others’ perspectives and try to find solutions that work for everyone.

I stay current on developments in my field and regularly read the upcoming technologies and learn new features of the tools and languages
I am committed to my professional growth and have taken [insert specific training here] training to improve my [insert specific skills here] skills.

 I like to figure things out myself and sometimes I don’t ask for help when I should.

“Over [insert time period], I have been able to [describe your accomplishment or goal you’ve met] by [insert percent or numeric value]. By [explain what you did to achieve this goal], [explain how it has affected how you do your work].
After reflecting on my performance, I recognized that [insert area for improvement]. [Explain why this is important or the background behind it]. By [explain what you will do differently], I will work to [insert SMART goal].”


Working on Hall-Of-Fame and Control Automation  projects has allowed me to rediscover my passion . I’ve thoroughly enjoyed working in an environment that conforms to my ideals and where I feel comfortable expressing myself and becoming the best version of myself. I’ll continue to strive to help the company grow and achieve its goals.”
